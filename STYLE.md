# Style Guide

## Colors


The preferred color for anything is always the primary color (white or
dark grey) of the specific icon set (see below).
Regarding color accents, we stick to the rule "if in doubt, leave it out".


### White theme

TBD


### Dark theme

The dark theme is designed to give good contrast on light backgrounds.
Hence, pastel colors are replaced by more opaque colors, and white
accents are replaced by dark grey filling.
All of these replacements happen automatically by calling the

```bash
dark-from-white.sh
```

script. Hence, only the white theme needs to be actively developed.
Anyway, it is recommended to use the white theme on dark background
(e.g. #202020 RGB) for your application.


## Shading

Icons are usually flat without gradients.
Exceptions can be made, e.g. if the purpose of an icon is to
represent a dedicated tool for gradients or spotlights.
